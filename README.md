Dataset Overview
Dataset: Toyota Corolla
Target Variable: Price
Features: Age, KM (kilometers driven), Fuel Type, Horsepower, Metallic Color, CC (engine size), Doors, Weight, and others.
Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps included:

Handling Missing Values:

Missing data in features such as Age, KM, and Fuel Type were handled using appropriate imputation methods (mean, median, or mode).
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Fuel Type and Metallic Color were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
Feature Scaling:

Features like KM, CC, and Weight were scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the data for better model performance.
Data Cleaning
Outlier Detection:
Outliers were identified using box plots and z-scores, and necessary actions were taken (removal or capping) to reduce their impact on the model.
Duplicates:
Duplicate rows were checked and removed from the dataset.
Data Visualization
Several visualizations were created to better understand the dataset and relationships between variables:

Correlation Matrix:
A heatmap to identify highly correlated features.

Pairplots:
Visualized the relationships between continuous variables.

Distribution of Features:
Plots showing the distribution of important features like Price, KM, and Age.

Modeling: Multiple Linear Regression
We implemented a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the price of a car. The basic steps involved:

Defining the independent variables (all the FEATURES) and the dependent variable (price).
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
Fitting the model using the training data and evaluating it on the test data.
Regularization Techniques
To prevent overfitting and improve generalization, we applied the following regularization techniques:

Lasso Regression:

Added L1 penalty to perform both regularization and feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less important features to zero.


Model Evaluation and Validation
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average magnitude of errors.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
R-Squared: Indicates how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
We performed cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Conclusion
The regularized models (Ridge and Lasso) significantly improved the model's ability to generalize compared to the plain multiple linear regression model.
Features like Age, KM, and Horsepower were identified as key drivers of the car price, while regularization helped in mitigating the impact of less important features.
